    "paragraph": "In computer science, algorithms are sets of instructions designed to perform specific tasks or solve problems. Algorithms can be implemented using various programming languages and are fundamental to fields such as artificial intelligence, data processing, and software development. The efficiency of an algorithm is often measured in terms of time complexity and space complexity. A good algorithm not only solves a problem but also does so efficiently, minimizing resources like processing time and memory. Some common algorithmic problems include sorting, searching, and optimization.",
